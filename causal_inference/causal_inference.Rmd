The Do-Calculus Rules:

1. Insertion/deletion of observations: 
$$P(y | do(x), z) = P(y | do(x)) \text{ if } Y \perp\!\!\!\perp Z | X \text{ in the mutilated graph.}$$ 
This rule applies when the outcome $Y$ is independent of the variable $Z$, given the intervention on $X$ in a graph where the usual influences on $X$ are removed.

2. Action/observation exchange: 
$$P(y | do(x), do(z)) = P(y | do(x), z) \text{ if } Y \perp\!\!\!\perp Z | X \text{ in the graph } G_{\overline{X}}.$$
Here, $\overline{X}$ means all incoming paths to $X$ are cut off, representing an intervention on $X$. This rule states that if $Y$ is independent of $Z$ given $X$ after this intervention, then observing $Z$ after intervening on $X$ gives the same outcome as intervening on both $X$ and $Z$.

3. Insertion/deletion of actions: 
$$P(y | do(x), do(z)) = P(y | do(x)) \text{ if } Y \perp\!\!\!\perp Z | X \text{ in the graph } G_{\overline{X}\underline{Z}}.$$
In this notation, $\overline{X}$ means that we intervene on $X$ (cutting all incoming arrows to $X$), and $\underline{Z}$ means we ignore the consequences of intervening on $Z$ (cutting all outgoing arrows from $Z$). This rule implies that if $Y$ is independent of $Z$ after $X$ is intervened upon and $Z$'s effects are removed, then intervening on $Z$ does not change the distribution of $Y$ after $X$ has been intervened on.
